There are number of communication technologies available for interaction between IoT devices today, and the most popular ones are WI-FI and bluetooth. the problem with these two devices is the high power power consumption. 
They also have limitations like limited range, limited access points.

Cellular networks also have the same problems of high power consumption and both LAN and Cellular network are quite expensive to cover a wide area . the IoT industries introduced lots of technologies, but none of them was ideal for IoT devices, until the LoRa technology was introduced. LoRa technology can perform very-long range transmission with low power consumption.


LoRa (Long Range) is a wireless technology that offers long range, low power, and secure data transmission for machine to machine and Iot applications.in europe region it operates in the 868 MHZ band and according to thge official information, LoRa can acheive a distance of 715 km when there is no obstacle between the Node and Gateway.

we installed the LoRa with sandeep mistry libraries on arduino Ide to easily send and receive LoRa packets with the ESP32


Issue: Testing sleep mode of ESP32 via external button to WakeUp
  -Programming ESP32 via Ftdi interface (uart0 + boot->GPIO0 + Rst->EN)
  -Test example code : going to sleep mode via external button to WakeUp (code : https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-deep-sleep-arduino-ide-wake-up-sources/)
Issue:  Testing sleep mode of ESP32 via RFM95
  Sub-Issue: Tx/Rx in LoRa 
            - Tranceiver: RFM95 / Receiver: Heltec  ESP32 //tranceiver is the heltec ESP32 and the receiver is the SX1262//(code:https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-lora-rfm95-transceiver-arduino-ide/)
             Changes on receiver code : ss 18 , dio0 26
             - ESP32 wakeUp via dio0 (goes high when packet received )    
  1st Solution :
    We will put esp on deep sleep mode , the tranceiver will send 52 consecutive packets one to wake the uC and the other to should contain the data
SPI FREQUENCY IS 16  MH

we replace the RFM95 with NiceRF which is similar to the RFM95, it's a new generation of LoRa RF.
Communication distance is up to 7km.
Maximum transmission power of 160mW.

Issue : Testing electronic board with ESP32E and SX1262 and heltec board 
  code used : https://github.com/StuartsProjects/SX12XX-LoRa
  Module Nice RF : https://www.nicerf.com/products/detail/915mhz-lora-module-lora1262.html
  The radiolib supporting the SX1262 : https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib
  
In the begining our target was to make the communication between the esp 32 and RFM95 and also to mesure power consumption between (esp32 and ftd232) 
also (esp32 and rfm95) so ESP32 power consumption on sleep mode was around 60 mW and on active mode around 528mW,
but the teacher gave us a new board where everything was already done (you will see it in the document "Doc") and for the board you can open it with Eagle IDE.

We just weld the component on the board and we add some conection : 
  Busy SX1262-> IO4 ESP 32 
  DIO1 SX1262-> IO12 ESP 32
  to 

we should reduce the power consumption with a radiolib command( https://jgromes.github.io/RadioLib/class_s_x1262.html#aa149463283dc9cddfec836ec6620d4dc )
