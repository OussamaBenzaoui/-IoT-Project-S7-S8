Power consumption on LoraScale_V1.51:
  ESP32E+SX1262 : 61 mA*3V3 = 201.3 mW
SX1262 on receive mode the current is around 6,80mA  
SX1262 on sleep mode the current is around 46uA
Now we want to mesure the power consumption of the SX1262 into the deep sleep mode we should have a current around Microamps.
So we deleted the transistor Q1 and placed two wires on the Q1 ports that we delete to mesure the current.
The role of the deep sleep mode:the module don't consume lots of current so if he receive a packet he will wake up so he will be on active mode and if he don't receive a packet he will switch on deep sleep mode.
The current consumption of SX1262 on deep sleep mode is about 46uA
