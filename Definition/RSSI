RSSI
The Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) is the received signal power in milliwatts and is measured in dBm.

This value can be used as a measurement of how well a receiver can “hear” a signal from a sender.

The RSSI is measured in dBm and is a negative value.

The closer to 0 the better the signal is.

Typical LoRa RSSI values are:

RSSI minimum = -120 dBm.

If RSSI=-30dBm: signal is strong.
If RSSI=-120dBm: signal is weak.
